- **`/packages`** Shared packages used by apps
  - `/tailwind` Tailwind config and base stylesheet with shared design guideline

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

[Yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) is required

Install the dependencies

```

### Build

```
yarn run build
```

Each project will be built and combined in root `/build` folder

## ‚öΩ Working style

- We use Trunk-based development.
  - No braches, we all push to main branch.
  - Pull rebase `git pull --rebase` often. Before you start coding and pushing.
  - Continuous integration: try not to leave your code without pushing overnight.
- **[TODO]** Each time the code is pushed to main branch, Github Action will build and deploy to the staging environment.
